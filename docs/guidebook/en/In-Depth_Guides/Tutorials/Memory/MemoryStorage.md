# MemoryStorage

MemoryStorage is responsible for the temporary or persistent storage of memories within the memory component.

## How to Define a MemoryStorage Component

Following the design characteristics of agentUniverse domain components, like other components, creating a memory
storage (memory_storage) definition consists of two parts:

- xx_memory_storage.yaml
- xx_memory_storage.py

xx_memory_storage.yaml contains important information such as the name, description, etc., of the memory_storage
component; xx_memory_storage.py contains the specific definition of the memory storage. After understanding this
principle, let's take a look at how to create these two parts.

## How to Use the MemoryStorage Component

### Creating a MemoryStorage Configuration - xx_memory_storage.yaml

#### An Actual Example of a Memory Storage Definition Configuration

```yaml
name: 'chroma_memory_storage'
description: 'demo chroma memory storage'
collection_name: 'memory'
persist_path: '../../DB/memory.db'
embedding_model: 'dashscope_embedding'
metadata:
  type: 'MEMORY_STORAGE'
  module: 'agentuniverse.agent.memory.memory_storage.chroma_memory_storage'
  class: 'ChromaMemoryStorage'
```

- name: The name of the memory storage, used to identify the memory storage.
- description: The description of the memory storage, used to indicate the purpose of the memory storage.
- collection_name: The name of the collection in ChromaDB.
- persist_path: The persistence path of ChromaDB.
- embedding_model: The name of the embedding model domain component.
- metadata: Component metadata, used to identify the type of memory storage, the package path it is in, and the class
  name.

### Creating MemoryStorage Domain Behavior Definition - xx_memory_storage.py

agentUniverse provides a base MemoryStorage class. You need to inherit it and override the add/delete/get functions to
complete the storage, deletion, and retrieval of memory information.

#### [Definition of MemoryStorage Class:](../../../../../../agentuniverse/agent/memory/memory_storage/memory_storage.py)

- add(self, message_list: List[Message], session_id: str = '', agent_id: str = '', **kwargs) -> None:
  : Memory information storage, stores the memory message list, agent ID (agent_id), session ID (session_id), source (
  memory source), and other information in a specific storage repository.

- delete(self, session_id: str = None, agent_id: str = None, **kwargs) -> None:
  : Memory information deletion, deletes the corresponding memory data in a specific storage repository, filtered by
  session ID (session_id), agent ID (agent_id), source (memory source), and other conditions.

- get(self, session_id: str = '', agent_id: str = '', top_k=10, **kwargs) -> List[Message]:
  : Memory information retrieval, obtains the corresponding memory data in a specific storage repository, filtered by
  agent ID (agent_id), session ID (session_id), source (memory source), and other conditions.

### Configuring and Using in Memory

As with the `chroma_memory_storage` instance created in the previous text, you can set it up in the memory like this:

```yaml
name: 'demo_memory'
# omitted part
memory_storages:
  - chroma_memory_storage
memory_retrieval_storage: chroma_memory_storage
# omitted part
```

### Pay Attention to the Package Path of Your Defined MEMORY_STORAGE

In the `config.toml` of the agentUniverse project, you need to configure the package corresponding to the MEMORY_STORAGE
configuration. Please confirm again that the package path where you created the file is under the `memory_storage` path
in `CORE_PACKAGE` or its sub-path.

For example, the configuration in the sample project is as follows:

```yaml
[CORE_PACKAGE]
memory_storage = ['sample_standard_app.intelligence.agentic.memory.memory_storage']
```

## agentUniverse currently has the following built-in MemoryStorage components:

### [local_memory_storage](../../../../../../agentuniverse/agent/memory/memory_storage/local_memory_storage.py)

Local memory storage, the system's built-in component configuration file is as follows:

```yaml
name: 'local_memory_storage'
description: 'local memory storage'
metadata:
  type: 'MEMORY_STORAGE'
  module: 'agentuniverse.agent.memory.memory_storage.local_memory_storage'
  class: 'LocalMemoryStorage'
```

### [chroma_memory_storage](../../../../../../agentuniverse/agent/memory/memory_storage/chroma_memory_storage.py)

ChromaDB Memory Storage, which includes vector retrieval and conditional retrieval when retrieving memories. The **example** component configuration file in the sample project is as follows:

```yaml
name: 'chroma_memory_storage'
description: 'demo chroma memory storage'
collection_name: 'memory'
persist_path: '../../DB/memory.db'
embedding_model: 'dashscope_embedding'
metadata:
  type: 'MEMORY_STORAGE'
  module: 'agentuniverse.agent.memory.memory_storage.chroma_memory_storage'
  class: 'ChromaMemoryStorage'
```

Here, `collection_name` is the name of the Chroma collection, `persist_path` is the persistence path for Chroma, and `embedding_model` is the name of the embedding domain component used for vector retrieval.

### [sql_alchemy_memory_storage](../../../../../../agentuniverse/agent/memory/memory_storage/sql_alchemy_memory_storage.py)

SqlAlchemy Memory Storage, which includes another domain component of aU, [SQLDB_WRAPPER](../../Tech_Capabilities/Storage/SQLDB_WRAPPER.md). The **example** component configuration file in the sample project is as follows:

```yaml
name: 'mysql_memory_storage'
description: 'demo mysql memory storage'
sqldb_table_name: 'memory'
sqldb_wrapper_name: 'mysql_sqldb_wrapper'
metadata:
  type: 'MEMORY_STORAGE'
  module: 'agentuniverse.agent.memory.memory_storage.sql_alchemy_memory_storage'
  class: 'SqlAlchemyMemoryStorage'
```

Here, `sqldb_table_name` is the table name for SqlAlchemy, and `sqldb_wrapper_name` is the instance name of the sqldb_wrapper domain component.

An example configuration for mysql_sqldb_wrapper is as follows:

```yaml
name: 'mysql_sqldb_wrapper'
description: 'mysql_sqldb_wrapper'
db_uri: "mysql+pymysql://root:root123456@127.0.0.1:3306/test"
engine_args:
  pool_size: 5
metadata:
  type: 'SQLDB_WRAPPER'
```

Here, `db_uri` is the database connection address, and `engine_args` are the engine parameters for SqlAlchemy.
