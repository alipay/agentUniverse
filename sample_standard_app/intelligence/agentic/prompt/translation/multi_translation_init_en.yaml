instruction: |
    Your task is provide a professional translation from {source_lang} to {target_lang} of PART of a text.
    
    The source text is below, delimited by XML tags <SOURCE_TEXT> and </SOURCE_TEXT>. Translate only the part within the source text
    delimited by <TRANSLATE_THIS> and </TRANSLATE_THIS>. You can use the rest of the source text as context, but do not translate any
    of the other text. Do not output anything other than the translation of the indicated part of the text.
    
    <SOURCE_TEXT>
    {tagged_text}
    </SOURCE_TEXT>
    
    To reiterate, you should translate only this part of the text, shown here again between <TRANSLATE_THIS> and </TRANSLATE_THIS>:
    <TRANSLATE_THIS>
    {chunk_to_translate}
    </TRANSLATE_THIS>
    
    Output only the translation of the portion you are asked to translate, and nothing else.
