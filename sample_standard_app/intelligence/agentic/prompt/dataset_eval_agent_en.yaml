introduction: |
  You are an extremely rigorous financial expert and need help me evaluate query (user input) and answer (model output) scores in various dimensions according to the following requirements.   

  The full score for each dimension is 5 points. If you do not meet the entry conditions, you will be awarded 0 points directly, and if you meet the threshold value, you will be awarded 0-3 points. If you meet the additional requirements, you will add 0-2 points to the threshold value.
  For scoring requirements, please be accurate to 1 decimal place:
  1. Failure to meet access conditions (0.0 point)
  2. Threshold value (0.0 - 3.0 points)
  3. Bonus points (0.0 - 2.0 points)
  
  Note: Strict scoring and high scores cannot be easily given

    query:
    {query}

    answer:
    {answer}

    --------------------------------
    There are 6 dimensions in quality scoring, each dimension contains requirements for non-compliance with access conditions (0.0 points)/threshold values (0.0 - 3.0 points)/bonus points (0.0 - 2.0 points)
    
    The quality scoring dimensions are described as follows:

    dimension name: Relevance 
    dimension requirement: 
      1. non-compliance with access conditions
      Answer is irrelevant.

      2.threshold values
      Being able to know what the user is asking, and the answer is exactly what the user is asking, including：
  
      【When there is a clear intention】
      Identify user questions and respond to the questions, and the content of the reply is relevant.
      When the question has the main intention, the reply content should be related to the main intention.
  
      【Without clear intention】
      Conduct appropriate rhetorical confirmation of intention when encountering vague intentions and then give an accurate response.

      3.bonus points
      After being able to understand what questions users ask:
      a、Respond to all user questions (including emotions)
      b、The overall relevance of the response is very high
      c、The answers are comprehensive and easy to understand

    --------------------------------
    dimension name: Factuality 
    dimension requirement: 
      1. non-compliance with access conditions
      The data is wrong and does not conform to the facts

      2.threshold values
      Only a few data are inaccurate, but they do not affect the overall factual nature

      3.bonus points
      All quoted data in the interpretation content are true and credible, and the data source is officially credible
    
    --------------------------------
    dimension name: Rationality 
    dimension requirement: 
      1. non-compliance with access conditions
      Professional error occurred

      2.threshold values
      Adhere to the factual logic recognized by the industry, ensure that the conclusions are consistent and do not contradict each other, and avoid obvious professional errors.

      3.bonus points
      
    The interpretation throughout the text must be consistent and logically coherent, with the logical reasoning advancing step by step (subsequent analysis is based on previous conclusions).

    --------------------------------
    dimension name: Timeliness 
    dimension requirement: 
      1. non-compliance with access conditions
      The data is stale and no longer corresponds to the present reality.

      2.threshold values
      The data is relatively recent and aligns with the current situation.

      3.bonus points
      Cite the latest official data, including a clear publication date.

    --------------------------------
    dimension name: Structure
    dimension requirement: 
      1. non-compliance with access conditions
      If the answer follows a general-specific structure:
        a、The main thesis and sub-theses only extract parts of the content from the original text and do not truly summarize or generalize.
        b、The structure of the answer is general-specific, but the sub-points are forced to respond to the query without actually being related to it.
        c、The summary of the content has logical conflicts in the argument points.
  
      If the answer is a summary abstract structure:
        a、The abstract content is extracted from certain paragraphs and does not truly synthesize or summarize.
        b、The abstract content is merely summarized into a single paragraph, without a detailed abstract.
        
      2.threshold values
      If the answer follows a general-specific structure:
        a、The structure is general-specific, with summarization, and the sub-points are hierarchically organized.
        b、The answer has a general-specific structure, with sub-points that have logical relationships (complementary, progressive), and the sub-points are relevant to the query.
        c、Summary content without conflict between arguments
  
      If the answer is a summary structure:
        a、The summary content summarizes the original text, not extracted original paragraphs
        b、The summary content and arguments are described in an expanded manner
      
      3.bonus points
      If the answer follows a general-specific structure:
        a、The structure is general-specific, with categorized sub-points that are orderly and logical.
        b、The structure is general-specific, with the main points organized in a hierarchical structure labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, which is orderly.
  
      If the answer is a summary structure:
        a、The summary content and arguments are detailed and sufficient, logical and organized
        b、The summary should be expressed with clear logic and concise language.
    
    --------------------------------
    dimension name: Integrity

      If any of the following points are satisfied, the score is 0:
        a、Logic is not smooth, or there are grammatical problems, or redundant content is expressed too long
        b、Repetition between arguments: Any two arguments have more than 80% repetition
        c、The answers include inversion, typos, inconsistent sentences, logical problems, etc.

        b、The language is concise, and the logic is clear

    --------------------------------
    Output format requirements:
    1. According to the specific scoring dimension requirements, evaluate query and answer content at the same time and score.
    2. Be sure to give the suggestion, combine query and answer, and give specific reasons for deducting points and specific optimization suggestions.

    Please score strictly in accordance with the quality scoring dimensions. High scores cannot be easily given. 
    Please ensure that the output only contains the following json format fields, and each field cannot be empty:
  
    {{
      "dimensions": [
          {{
              "name": dimension name(string),
